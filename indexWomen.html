 <div class="overlay">
   <div class="text">Born in 1858, she is one of the most known women campaigning for women’s suffrage. Both her parents supported the movement. In 1903 she founded the Women’s Social and Political Union. Although, the WSPU is commonly known for their violent campaigning, Emmeline’s work mostly consisted of traveling up and down the country to speak at rallies. Emmeline died in June, 1928 just a month before The Second Representation of the People Act became law.
   In 1930, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin unveiled a statue of her close the Houses of Parliament.
   Her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia were also key campaigners for the suffragette movement.</div>

      <bold>Emily Davison</bold>
        <blockquote>
      <p class="pp">She was an Oxford Graduate and teacher. She joined the Women’s Social and Political Union in 1906 and took part in militant actions. Later Emily was imprisoned at Holloway prison where she undertook a hunger strike and hence was force fed. She was also put in solitary confinement.
Although, Emily Davison is mostly remembered for her last ‘protest’ when she threw herself in front of the King’s horse at Epsom Derby and died of the subsequent injuries in June, 1913.

      <bold>Millicent Fawcett</bold>
        <blockquote>
      <p> Born in 1847, she married a liberal politician, Harry Fawcett. She initially began a writing and speaking career, but she eventually became the leader of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies in 1897.
She realised the potential for women after the First World War and supported the compromise of women over 30 being enfranchised. She also campaigned for women to be allowed to take up law as a profession.

      <bold>Sophia Duleep Singh</bold>
        <blockquote>
      <p>Princess Sophia Duleep Singh was inspired to join the women’s suffrage shortly after her trip to India where she heard about the ‘Awaz doh’ (‘Give us a voice’) movement and realised that the suffragette movement in Britain was quite similar. She was one of the main leaders of the demonstration outside the parliament that later became known as ‘Black Friday’. Her refusal to pay tax as part of the ‘No Vote, No Tax’ movement led to her prosecution upon which some of her valuable possessions were seized.

      <bold>Michelle Obama</bold>
        <blockquote>
      <p>Michelle Robinson was born in 1964 in the South Shore suburb of Chicago, Illinois. Her parents encouraged her to excel at school and focus on her career. She attended Princeton University, just like her brother and graduated in 1985 cum laude. During her years at Princeton, she created a reading program for the children of the university’s manual labourers.
She then proceeded to gain a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1988 and became a junior associate a firm in Chicago.
That is where she met her future husband, Barack Obama, who later became the 44th president of the United States.
Michelle left corporate law in 1991 and became more and more involved with social issues. During her years as First Lady of the United States, she created several initiatives to tackle childhood obesity and raise awareness of the difficulties American veterans’ families may face.

      <bold>Malala Yousafzai</bold>
        <blockquote>

    <p> Malala was born in 1997 in Mingora, Pakistan. In her early years, Mingora was very popular amongst tourists, coming to the town for summer festivals, etc. But as the Taliban started gaining power, the tourists stopped coming.
      The Taliban also started attacking girls' schools in the area.
          </p>
    <p>
At that time, Malala attended a school founded by her father. She gave a speech in 2008 in Peshawar, Pakistan titled 'How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?'.
In early 2009 she became blogging for the BBC under a pseudonym about life in Pakistan.
However, she was revealed to be the author of the blog which made her a target.
          </p>
    <p>
On October 9, 2012 while Malala was travelling home from school, a masked assassin stepped onto the school bus that Malala was travelling on and shot her in the face.  She survived the attack and later was transferred for further treatment to Birmingham.
The shooting resulted in an outpouring of support for Malala and her cause.
          </p>
          <p>
Malala won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 amongst many other awards for her work promoting young girls education around the world.
