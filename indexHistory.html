  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
      The fundamental human right that we all enjoy today; the right to vote has not always been accessible to all members of society. It was only in 1928 when eventually every grown-up person gained the right to vote.

    <blockquote>
Before 1928 there had been many attempts to change the law and give not just women, but working-class people more say in the country’s affairs, but they achieved very little. For instance; with the Married Women’s Property Act of 1882 women were able to keep their wealth after marrying whereas before, their properties were automatically signed over to their husbands. Which only resulted in that now they had to pay taxes after their properties but didn’t have a say in what those taxes were used for. Just as working-class people, who didn’t have any influence on policy making either.

        <blockquote>
Movements that fought for the ‘Right to Vote’ for everyone used two approach. NUWSS, National Union of Woman’s Suffrage Societies held public meetings and tried to lobby the parliament with petitions, whereas the WSPU, Women’s Social and Political Union took a more direct approach, using violent and disruptive tools such as chaining themselves to railings, set fire to buildings and business premises to gain attention for their cause.

        <blockquote>
After decades of campaign from 1918 many amendments were added that included more and more women and men into the righteous voters, eventually in 1928 the Equal Franchise Act granted right to vote for everyone.
